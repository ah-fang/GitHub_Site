        <h3><em>Respite</em></h3>
        <p>Steady, steady, feel it rumbling,<br>
            Turn your fingers into stone,<br>
            Spark new trust upon the granite,<br> 
            Loose your tension with a groan.<br>
            Sink your knees into the topsoil,<br>
            Rest your chaos-weary head,<br>
            In the weeping wooden thicket<br>
            (How it feared that you were dead!)<br>
            Let it feel your flame so vital<br>
            That it banishes all doubt.<br>
            Sleep now, darling. Rest. Recover.<br>
            Only time shall bring you out.

        <h3><em>Suspicion</em></h3>
        <p>
        Would they change, beloved, knowing<br>
        Of the turning of the sands?<br>
        Would they blanch like lightless saplings?<br> 
        Or recoil from your hands?<br>
        Do they let their wantings wander<br>
        From their loudest daily needs?<br>
        Dare they raise their heads from squabbles<br>
        Over cottages and weeds?<br>
        Could their eyes behold a coming<br>
        Of an age beyond our years?<br>
        Did the shrill and distant singing<br>
        Reach the edges of their ears?<br>
        There are questions, fairest pilgrim,<br>
        That this spirit cannot claim<br>
        To have answered, though oft wondered,<br>
        So instead I speak your name,<br>
        Just a whisper in the breezes<br>
        Til youâ€™re ready for the call,<br>
        You are older, stronger, wiser,<br>
        You have stayed beyond them all.<br>
