            <h3><em>Respite</em></h3>
            <p>
                Steady, steady, feel it rumbling,<br>
                Turn your fingers into stone,<br>
                Spark new trust upon the granite,<br> 
                Loose your tension with a groan.<br>
                Sink your knees into the topsoil,<br>
                Rest your chaos-weary head,<br>
                In the weeping wooden thicket<br>
                (How it feared that you were dead!)<br>
                Let it feel your flame so vital<br>
                That it banishes all doubt.<br>
                Sleep now, darling. Rest. Recover.<br>
                Only time shall bring you out.

            <h3><em>Suspicion</em></h3>
            <p>
            Would they change, beloved, knowing<br>
            Of the turning of the sands?<br>
            Would they blanch like lightless saplings<br> 
            Or recoil from your hands?<br>
            Do they let their wantings wander<br>
            From their loudest daily needs?<br>
            Dare they raise their heads from squabbles<br>
            Over cottages and weeds?<br>
            Could their eyes behold a coming<br>
            Of an age beyond our years?<br>
            Did the shrill and distant singing<br>
            Reach the edges of their ears?<br>
            Would the ancient score of malice<br>
            Sling another cutting stroke?<br>
            Did our flailing acts of valor<br>
            Free you from the curse's choke?<br>
